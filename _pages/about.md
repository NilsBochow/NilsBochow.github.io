Hi, I am Nils, a climate scientist at [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/nils.bochow). I hold a BSc in Experimental Physics from the [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/de), a MSc in Theoretical Physics from the [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/de) and a double-degree PhD in Science from [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://uit.no/startsida) as well as a PhD in Earth and Planetary System Science from the [University of Copenhagen](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/research/pice/).

I am mostly interested in Earth system science with a focus on tipping elements, the cryosphere, ice sheet modelling, machine learning and numerical modelling in general. 
In previous work, I investigated the [long-term stability of the Greenland ice sheet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06503-9), the potential for critical transitions in the [South-American monsoon system and Amazon rainforest](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add9973) or applied [machine learning methods to learn more about the climate's past](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp0558). 

I am always interested in collaboration, just contact me. I also offer Master and Bachelor thesis topics, if you are interested.
