Model checkpoints for LaMa, LaMa random, LaMa(years) on tas and LaMa trained on the sea ice concentration  are provided. 

Netcdf files for the sitewise and spatial RMSE of the different models on the test set are provided.

Additionally, we provide the reconstructed fields shown in the paper as well as an archived version of the original LaMa source code and our modified version.

This repository contains the supplementary code for the article The South American monsoon approaches a critical transition in response to deforestation by Bochow and Boers (2023).


The code for analysis is located in the folder Analysis. Build the Python environment with all required packages via conda env create -f environment.yml. It will create a conda environment called myclone.


The model is written in Julia with Python snippets. The model was written using Julia 1.3.0.
